# Introduction

TODO: Will be expanded if published.

Inspired by [Nicolle et al. (2021)](https://hess.copernicus.org/articles/25/5013/2021/)

Expanded to estimate and compare slopes of relationship between model errors and input climate, using a hierarchical linear regression approach if multiple catchments are considered simultaneously.

# Getting Started
