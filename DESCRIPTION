Description: Tests for a linear relationship in the log ratio between an observed and simulated series and an independent variable. Typically this the error in modelled streamflow at an annual time scale, and a rainfall input. The approach allows for multiple sites as random factors and for multiple replicates of the simulated values. The approach is outlined in Gibbs et al. (2026) in review.
